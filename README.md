# Loan Approval Analysis

# Problem Statement
The objective of this analysis is to identify the key factors influencing loan approval decisions and to evaluate whether customer attributes such as income, credit score, assets, education, employment type, and dependents can predict loan approval outcomes.

# Dataset Overview

Target Variable: loan_status

Key Attributes: CIBIL score, income, loan amount, total assets, education, employment type, number of dependents

# Key Insights

1. Credit score (CIBIL) is the primary and strongest driver of loan approval, with approved applicants having significantly higher average scores.

2. Income-to-loan ratio, total assets, and number of dependents show minimal variation between approved and rejected cases, indicating they are not decisive on their own.

3. Education and employment type slightly influence approval rates, with higher education and salaried employment showing marginally better outcomes.

# Conclusion
Loan approval follows a credit-first decision framework, where credit score determines eligibility, while other attributes act as supporting validation factors rather than independent predictors.
